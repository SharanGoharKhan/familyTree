    This editable organizational chart sample color-codes the Nodes according to the tree level in the hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Double click on a node in order to add a person or the diagram background to add a new boss. Double clicking the diagram uses the <a>ClickCreatingTool</a>
    with a custom <a>ClickCreatingTool.insertPart</a> to assign an ID.
  </p>
  <p>
    Drag a node onto another in order to change relationships.
    You can also draw a link from a node's background to other nodes that have no "boss". Links can also be relinked to change relationships.
    Right-click or tap-hold a Node to bring up a context menu which allows you to:
    <ul>
      <li>Vacate Position - remove the information specfic to the current person in that role</li>
      <li>Remove Role - removes the role entirely and reparents any children</li>
      <li>Remove Department - removes the role and the whole subtree</li>
    </ul>
    Deleting a Node or Link will orphan the child Nodes and generate a new tree. A custom SelectionDeleting <a>DiagramEvent</a> listener will clear out the boss info
    when the parent is removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Select a node to edit/update node data values. This sample uses the <a href="../extensions/dataInspector.html">Data Inspector</a> extension to display and modify Part data.

    If you want to have some "assistant" nodes on the side, above the regular reports,
    see the <a href="orgChartAssistants.html">Org Chart Assistants</a> sample, which is a copy of this sample
    that uses a custom <a>TreeLayout</a> to position "assistants" that way.
